## Supported Players

2. [PotPlayer](https://potplayer.daum.net/) Recommend in Windows

## Players to be supported
1. ~~[mpv](https://mpv.io/)~~ Because the mpv player is not automatically registered as a protocol handler in the operating system, it is quite troublesome to handle, and support is not currently being considered. If someone is willing to add pmv support, please submit a request.
2. ~~[mpc-be](https://github.com/Aleksoid1978/MPC-BE)~~ Same reason as mpv player.
